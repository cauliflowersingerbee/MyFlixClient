About The Project
MyFlixClient

After creating the MyFlixDB REST API to store data about movies and users, this App moves from the backend server-side to the client-facing frontend. 

The myFlix app allows users to make requests to a MongoDB database. This is the client-side of that app. Its purpose is to create an interface that users can interact with while using the movie app. 

Responses from the server will be rendered into the interface: movie synopses, director biographies, genres, etc. 

MyFlixClient is built With Javascript, React, SCSS, & HTML
