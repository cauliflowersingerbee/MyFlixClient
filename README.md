## Objective

Client-side of the MyFlix API built using the MERN tech stack
(MongoDB, Express, React, and
Node.js).

## Design Criteria

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to access information on movies, directors, and genres so
that I can learn more about movies Iâ€™ve watched or am interested in.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite
movies.

## Features & Requirements

#### Main view
- Returns a list of ALL movies to the user (each listed item with an image, title, and
description)
- Sorting and filtering
- Ability to select a movie for more details

#### Single movie view
- Returns data (description, genre, director, image) about a single movie to the user
- Allows users to add a movie to their list of favorites

#### Login view
- Allows users to log in with a username and password
Registration view
- Allows new users to register (username, password, email, birthday)

#### Genre view
- Returns data about a genre, with a name and description

#### Profile view

## Technical Requirements
- Single-page application (SPA)
- Built with React and the MERN stack
- Uses state routing to navigate between views and share URLs
- Uses Parcel as its build tool
- Written with React Redux (hence respecting the Flux pattern)
